# Sumikko-Gurashi-Virtual-Pet-Game

"Sumikko Gurashi Virtual Pet" is a Scala-based virtual pet management game using ScalaFX GUI library. Players care for a virtual pet, Penguin, from the Sumikko Gurashi cartoon, ensuring it is well-fed, clean, and happy. The pet's status for hunger, cleanliness, and happiness is displayed. To feed the pet, players buy food with coins earned by playing a "Whack-A-Mole" inspired minigame. Various foods affect pet metrics differently, necessitating strategic resource management.
